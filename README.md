**MinimalChat** is an open-source LLM chat web app designed to be as self-contained as possible. All conversations are stored locally on the client's device, with the only information being sent to the server being API calls to GPT, PaLM or Claude (uses a CORS proxy) chat when the user sends a message and when a user saves a conversation to generate a conversation title.

## Obtaining API Keys

To use MinimalGPT with the various language models, you'll need to obtain API keys from their respective providers:

- **OpenAI (GPT-3, GPT-4)**: Sign up for an API key at [OpenAI's website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).
- **Google PaLM**: Follow the instructions in the [Google PaLM API documentation](https://developers.generativeai.google/tutorials/setup) to set up your API key.
- **Anthropic Claude-3**: Request access to the Claude API by filling out the form on [Anthropic's website](https://www.anthropic.com/product).

Once you have your API keys, input them in the app's settings to start using the corresponding language models.

### Tip for mobile users

On iOS/Android devices in your browser, you can install supported web applications (called PWA or Progressive Web Applications) like native mobile apps to your devices homescreen. This means even though it is a website it is nearly indistinguishable from a normal iOS/Android application.

On iOS press the **Share** button in the browser and find the option that says **Add to Home Screen**. Pressing that will install the web application to your home screen.

On Android the process is basically the same except the name of the option is **Install App**

**Q: Can I use MinimalGPT without an internet connection?**
A: No, MinimalGPT requires an internet connection to communicate with the language model APIs.

**Q: Are my conversations secure and private?**
A: Yes, all conversations are stored locally on your device and are not sent to any servers other than the necessary API calls to the language models.

**Q: Can I use MinimalGPT on my mobile device?**
A: Yes, MinimalGPT is designed be responsive and works well on mobile devices. You can even install it as a PWA for a native app-like experience.

## Features

- Minimal layout
- Models Supported
  - **GPT 3.5**
  - **GPT 4**
  - **GPT-4-Turbo**
  - **GPT-Vision** activated by having the **GPT-4 or GPT-Turbo** model selected and starting a message with **vision::** and then your prompt
  - **PaLM 2**
  - **Claude 3 Opus**
  - **Claude 3 Sonnet**
  - **Claude 3 Haiku**
  - **Claude Vision** activated by having the **Claude** model selected and starting a message with **vision::** and then your prompt
  - **Local LLM Model (Via [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/))** users configure the current model name and [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) api endpoint url in the settings panel.
    - **Local Model Name**: The name of the model you are hosting locally 
    - **Example**: [This DeepSeek Coder Model](https://huggingface.co/LoneStriker/deepseek-coder-7b-instruct-v1.5-GGUF) has a model name of `LoneStriker/deepseek-coder-7b-instruct-v1.5-GGUF`. That is what should be entered into the **Local Model Name** field. This is also displayed directly in **[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)** for the user.
  - **Local URL**: The API endpoint URL that **[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)** is running on
    - **Note**: The endpoint must end with `v1/chat/completions` to function. e,g `http://192.168.0.82:1234/v1/chat/completions`

## Credits

MinimalGPT is made possible thanks to the following libraries, frameworks, and resources:

- [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/)
- [Google PaLM API](https://developers.generativeai.google/)
- [Anthropic Claude API](https://www.anthropic.com/)

## License

MinimalGPT is released under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). See the `LICENSE` file for more information.

## Run Web App Locally

To run the web app locally, you'll need `NodeJS` installed so NPM is available. Then, navigate to the project directory in VSCode and run the following commands:

1. Install needed packages: `npm install`
2. Start local server: `npm run start-server` (terminal will output the IP and port the server is running on)
3. That's it! The app is now running locally.

### Compiling Your SCSS to CSS

- Run the command `npm run scss-build`

### Building/Bundling (WIP)

- Running `npm run build` will perform a dist build gulpfile process that incldues minification and cache busting (sort of) and output to the `public` folder.
